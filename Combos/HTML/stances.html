  <h1>Orthodox Stance</h1>
    <img src="orthodox.jpg" width="305" height="499" class="exampleImage" />
    
    	<p>To adopt an orthodox stance, you should stand with your feet 
lined up heel to toe at a forty-five degree angle both shoulder-
width apart. Your back foot should be about half a step 
behind your front foot forward at a forty-five degree angle, 
towards your opponent. </p>

<p>If your dominant boxing hand is your right hand, your left foot 
will lead. Lift your right heel off the ground by about 3 inches 
and point both feet inward (although do not exaggerate this 
movement). In a properly balanced stance, you should be able to 
maintain an upright position and not fall to the ground or sway 
from side to side. To increase the stability of your stance, keep 
your knees and hips slightly bent but make sure your back is 
straight.</p>
<p>
Your lead fist (which will be your left fist if your dominant 
boxing hand is your right hand) should be positioned vertically at 
eye level, approximately six inches away from your face. Your 
right fist should be positioned next to your chin, with your elbow 
held against your ribcage. This is good defensive positioning and 
will effectively protect your body.</p>
